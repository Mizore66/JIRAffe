The final version of the project is completed. This project is inspired by JIRA which is one of the software tools that this AGILE team used throughout development. 

The main concept of this project is to be an AGILE sprint planner, by allowing teams to create a project, and then with said project create a product backlog. The product backlog's main purpose is to store user stories for the developing project. The details shown per story in the backlog are the field the story involves itself in, the story description itself, a priority level from "Not important" to "Urgent", as well as story point value, and lastly the developer who is assigned to the story.
The product backlog also contains feature to add,delete or edit any user stories into the backlog.

The next part of this application called "JIRAffe" is the sprint backlog and sprint planner, which is that developers are allowed to create sprints which is just a subset of user stories in the product backlog, that are set to be completed by a set date, this is done in the sprint planner. Once the sprint has started, the developer can go into the sprint backlog of said sprint and be able to place the user stories of the sprint into a Kanban Board that has 3 columns with the labels of "Not Started", "Working on", "Completed". Another thing a developer can do in the sprint backlog is to log hours into the task itself to show off how much work has been put in the task, and said data will be used to graph a burndown chart.

Last but not least, there's a section in the app for team view, which allows developers to see who is in the project development team, as well as to see the average amount of hours they have put into their work, while also being able to change the range of the date to see how much work has been done during said time period. If the Scrum master of the team is in team view, they're allowed to remove anyone from the team.

One extra feature of the app is that the user can change their user details in the settings.
